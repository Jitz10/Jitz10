## 🌱 About

I’m a final-year AIML student at SPIT, Mumbai, with hands-on experience across  
**applied machine learning, Generative AI systems, and research-driven projects**.

I’m particularly interested in problems where:
- models need **discipline**, not just scale  
- pipelines must be **robust**, not impressive  
- AI needs to justify *why* it works, not just *that* it works

## 🚀 Selected Projects (click to explore)

### 🧠 Brain Tumor Segmentation — Deep Learning + Explainability (IIT Jammu)  
🔗 https://github.com/Jitz10/Brain-Tumor-Segmentation  

<details>
<summary><b>What was the goal?</b></summary>

To build a reliable brain tumor segmentation system that not only performs well,  
but also provides **interpretability** — a critical requirement in medical AI.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>How was this approached?</b></summary>

- Implemented **DeepLabV3+** with a ResNet backbone for pixel-level segmentation  
- Trained and evaluated on multi-class MRI tumor data  
- Integrated **XAI techniques** (Grad-CAM) to visualize model focus regions  
- Emphasized robustness, not just metric optimization
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Why this matters</b></summary>

Medical imaging models are often treated as black boxes.  
This project focused on **trust, interpretability, and clinical relevance**,  
not just segmentation accuracy.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Collaboration</b></summary>

- Conducted as part of a research internship associated with **IIT Jammu**
</details>

### 🧩 AlphaSage — GenAI for Equity Research  
🔗 https://github.com/Jsh-Agarwal/AlphaSage  

<details>
<summary><b>Problem</b></summary>

Equity research is fragmented across PDFs, tables, and scanned filings,  
making analysis slow and error-prone.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>System design</b></summary>

- Unified pipeline for **textual, tabular, and visual financial data**
- OCR, parsing, retrieval, and reasoning treated as a single workflow
- Designed for extensibility beyond one dataset or domain
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Validation</b></summary>

- 🥈 2nd Runner-up — GenAI Hackathon (Vijaybhoomi University)  
- 🏅 Top 4 — JPMC Tech Week
</details>

### 🚨 RakshaSetu — Incident Reporting & Classification  
🔗 https://github.com/Jsh-Agarwal/RakshaSetu_WestWarriors  

<details>
<summary><b>Intent</b></summary>

To improve how incidents and crimes are reported, categorized, and triaged  
using AI as a **support layer**, not a replacement.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Key design choices</b></summary>

- Emphasis on reliability and clarity  
- AI used for classification and prioritization  
- Built with public-facing system constraints in mind
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Recognition</b></summary>

- 🥈 2nd Runner-up — Odoo Hackathon (SVNIT)
</details>

### ☁️ DualScope-LSTM — Cloud Resource Forecasting  
🔗 https://github.com/Jitz10/DualScope-LSTM-Adaptive-Dual-Branch-Modeling-for-Cloud-Resource-Forecasting  

<details>
<summary><b>Focus</b></summary>

Understanding how short-term fluctuations and long-term trends interact  
in real-world cloud workloads.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Learning outcome</b></summary>

This project reinforced that good forecasting is as much about  
**evaluation, data behavior, and assumptions** as it is about model architecture.
</details>

### 💬 Java Interview Chatbot — Fine-Tuned LLM (SPIT Internship)  
🔗 https://github.com/vvinayakkk/Interview_chatbot  

<details>
<summary><b>What was built?</b></summary>

A Java interview chatbot based on a **fine-tuned language model**,  
trained specifically on Java concepts and interview-style questioning.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Why fine-tuning?</b></summary>

Generic prompting failed to capture depth and progression.  
Fine-tuning enabled:
- Better concept grounding  
- Structured evaluation of answers  
- Adaptive difficulty progression
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Context</b></summary>

- Built as part of a **Generative AI internship at SPIT**
</details>
