## 🌱 About

I’m a final-year AIML student at SPIT, Mumbai.  
I enjoy working at the intersection of **machine learning, systems, and product thinking** —  
especially where GenAI needs structure to be useful.

Most of my projects focus on turning ideas into **cohesive pipelines**, not just models.

## 🚀 Selected Projects

### 🧩 Core Work

| Project | What it is | Why it matters | Links |
|-------|-----------|---------------|------|
| **AlphaSage** | GenAI-powered equity research system | Automates analysis over reports, tables, and scanned docs using a unified GenAI pipeline | [Repo](https://github.com/Jsh-Agarwal/AlphaSage) |
| **RakshaSetu** | Incident & crime reporting platform | Uses AI for classification and triage while keeping reliability and usability first | [Repo](https://github.com/Jsh-Agarwal/RakshaSetu_WestWarriors) |
| **DualScope-LSTM** | Cloud resource forecasting model | Explores temporal + long-term trends in real cloud workloads | [Repo](https://github.com/Jitz10/DualScope-LSTM-Adaptive-Dual-Branch-Modeling-for-Cloud-Resource-Forecasting) |
| **Java Interview Chatbot** | Interview preparation assistant | Turns static interview prep into an interactive, adaptive experience | [Repo](https://github.com/vvinayakkk/Interview_chatbot) |

## 🧠 What I like building

| Area | Focus |
|----|------|
| **Generative AI** | RAG systems, LLM fine-tuning, multi-agent workflows |
| **Machine Learning** | Forecasting, classification, decision-support models |
| **Systems** | Backend-heavy AI apps where infra and data matter |
| **Applied Research** | Models that answer *why*, not just *what* |

---

## 🛠 Tools & Tech (I actually use)

| Category | Tools |
|-------|------|
| **Languages** | Python, Java, C++, SQL |
| **ML / DL** | PyTorch, TensorFlow, Scikit-learn |
| **GenAI** | LLM fine-tuning, LoRA, RAG, Prompt Engineering |
| **Backend** | Flask, FastAPI |
| **Cloud & Data** | Azure ML, Databricks, AWS S3, PostgreSQL, MongoDB |
| **DevOps** | Docker, GitHub Actions |

## 🌍 Outside the code

I enjoy:
- Breaking down complex systems until they feel obvious  
- Reading postmortems more than hype blogs  
- Building things slightly beyond my comfort zone

## 🤝 Let’s connect

If you’re working on:
- Applied GenAI systems  
- ML products with real users  
- Research ideas that want to escape PDFs  

I’d love to talk.
