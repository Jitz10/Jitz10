### 🧩 AlphaSage — GenAI-Powered Equity Research  
🔗 https://github.com/Jsh-Agarwal/AlphaSage  

<details>
<summary><b>Problem</b></summary>

Equity research involves fragmented data across PDFs, tables, and scanned filings,  
making manual analysis slow and error-prone.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>System Design</b></summary>

- Unified pipeline for **textual, tabular, and visual financial data**  
- OCR, parsing, retrieval, and LLM-based reasoning treated as a single workflow  
- Designed to scale beyond a single dataset or market
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Recognition</b></summary>

- 🥈 2nd Runner-up — GenAI Hackathon (Vijaybhoomi University)  
- 🏅 Top 4 Teams — JPMC Tech Week
</details>

### 🚨 RakshaSetu — Incident Reporting & Classification  
🔗 https://github.com/Jsh-Agarwal/RakshaSetu_WestWarriors  

<details>
<summary><b>Intent</b></summary>

An AI-assisted platform to improve incident and crime reporting,  
using ML for classification and prioritization rather than automation for its own sake.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Key Ideas</b></summary>

- AI as a decision-support layer  
- Focus on usability, clarity, and robustness  
- Designed for public-facing system constraints
</details>

<details>

🔗 https://github.com/vvinayakkk/Interview_chatbot  

<details>
<summary><b>Overview</b></summary>

A Java interview chatbot built using a **fine-tuned language model**,  
designed to evaluate depth of understanding rather than keyword recall.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Key Contributions</b></summary>

- Domain-specific fine-tuning for Java concepts and interview patterns  
- Structured answer evaluation with adaptive difficulty progression  
- Built as part of a **Generative AI internship at SPIT**
</details>
